PacMan Machine Learning Artificial Intelligence Project

Basic Search is a implementation of search algorithms for tree structures (BFS, DFS, etc). 

Multiagent search is an implementation of tree structure search algorithms used for multiplayer games like pacman. Algorithms include MiniMax, ExpectiMax, Alpha-Beta prunning, Reflex agents, and heuristic based approaches.

Reinforcement learning is an implementation of simple machine learning algorithms like value iteration, Q learning, and reinforcemnt learning itself. These approaches take a more general approach to playing pacman using features extracted along with weights updated through training.
